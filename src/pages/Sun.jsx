          The Sun, a magnificent ball of hot, glowing gas, is at the center of
          our solar system. It is a vital celestial body that provides heat,
          light, and energy to sustain life on Earth.

        Size and Structure
      </h1>
      <ul>
        <li className="mt-2">
          The sun is approximately 109 times the diameter of the Earth. To put
          into perspective, you could fit about 1.3 million Earths inside the
          Sun!
        </li>
        <li className="mt-2">
          It is composed mainly of hydrogen (about 74%) and helium (about 24%)
          with trace amounts of other elements.
        </li>
        <li className="mt-2">
          The Sun consists of several layers including the core, radiative zone,
          convective zone, photosphere, chromosphere, and corona.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1 className="mt-4 text-2xl text-orange-special text-center">
        Energy Production
      </h1>
      <ul>
        <li className="mt-2">
          The Sun generates energy through a process called nuclear fission. In
          it&apos;s core, hydrogen atoms combine to form helium, releasing an
          enormous amount of energy in the process.
        </li>
        <li className="mt-2">
          This energy produced by the Sun is equivalent to converting about 700
          million tons of hydrogen into helium every second!
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h1 className="mt-4 text-2xl text-orange-special text-center">
        Temperature and Brightness
      </h1>
      <ul>
        <li className="mt-2">
          The surface temperature of the Sun is around 5500&deg; Celsius
          (9932&deg; Farenheit). However, the temperature increases
          significantly in the Sun&apos;s core, reaching about 15 million
          degrees Celsius (27 million degrees Farenheit)!
        </li>
        <li className="mt-2">
          The Sun appears to so bright to us because it is approximately 400,000
          times brighter than the full Moon.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h1 className="mt-4 text-2xl text-orange-special text-center">
        Sunspots and Solar Flares
      </h1>
      <ul>
        <li className="mt-2">
          Sunspots are temporary dark spots that appear on the Sun&apos;s
          surface. They are cooler regions caused by intense magnetic activity
          and can last for days or weeks.
        </li>
        <li className="mt-2">
          Solar flares, on the other hand, are sudden eruptions of intense
          radiation and charged particles from the Sun&apos;s surface. These
          events can release vast amounts of energy into space.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h1 className="mt-4 text-2xl text-orange-special text-center">
        Solar Wind and the Sun&apos;s Influence
      </h1>
      <ul>
        <li className="mt-2">
          The sun constantly emits a stream of charged particles known as the
          Solar Wind.This wind interacts with Earth&apos;s magnetic field,
          causing phenomena such as the auroras (northern and southern lights).
        </li>
        <li className="mt-2">
          Solar activity, including solar flaresand coronal mass injections, can
          impact our technological infrastructure, causing disruptions in
          satellite communications and power grids.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h1 className="mt-4 text-2xl text-orange-special text-center">
        Sun-Earth Connection
      </h1>
      <ul>
        <li className="mt-2">
          The Sun plays a crucial role in Earth&apos;s climate and weather
          patterns. Its energy drives atmospheric circulation, ocean currents,
          and the water cycle/hydrological cycle.
        </li>
        <li className="mt-2">
          Sunlight is essential for photosynthesis, the process by which plants
          convert carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and glucose, providing
          the foundation of life on Earth
